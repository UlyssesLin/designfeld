ELAINE,1:35,1:37,Huh. All right. Come on.,2
JERRY,1:37,1:48,"There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly referred to as the Soup Nazi.",3
ELAINE,1:48,1:50,Why? What happens if you don't order right?,3
JERRY,1:50,1:52,He yells and you don't get your soup.,3

JERRY,2:02,2:04,The main thing is to keep the line moving.,3
GEORGE,2:04,2:09,"All right. So, you hold out your money, speak your soup in a loud, clear voice, step to the left and receive.",3
JERRY,2:09,2:15,Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments. No questions. No compliments.,3
ELAINE,2:15,2:16,"Oh, boy, I'm really scared!",3
JERRY,2:16,2:18,Elaine.,3

JERRY,3:09,3:11,Hard to believe.,3
BANIA,3:11,3:16,"This guy makes the best soup in the city, Jerry. The best. You know what they call him? Soup Nazi.",3
JERRY,3:16,3:17,"Shhhhh! All right, Bania, I - I'm not letting you cut in line.",3
BANIA,3:17,3:20,Why not?,3
JERRY,3:20,3:22,"Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup again.",3

JERRY,4:44,4:57,"Oh, man. Ohh! This is fantastic. How does he do it?",3
GEORGE,4:57,5:01,"You know, I don't see how you can sit there eating that and not even offer me any?",3
JERRY,5:01,5:03,I gave you a taste. What do you want?,3
GEORGE,5:03,5:05,Why can't we share?,3
JERRY,5:05,5:10,"I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly flaunt the rules and then think I'm gonna share with you!",3
GEORGE,5:10,5:11,Do you hear yourself?,3
JERRY,5:11,5:17,I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime.,3

ELAINE,6:22,6:23,Mulligatawny?,3
KRAMER,6:23,6:28,Yeah. It's an Indian soup. It's simmered to perfection by one of the great soup artisans in the modern era.,3
ELAINE,6:29,6:31,Oh! Who? The Soup Nazi?,3
KRAMER,6:31,6:36,He's not a Nazi. He just happens to be a little eccentric. Most geniuses are.,3
ELAINE,6:37,6:38,All right. I'll be back.,3
KRAMER,6:38,6:39,Wait a second. You don't even know how to order.,3

JERRY,11:16,11:18,It was a bisque.,3
ELAINE,11:19,11:25,"Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly, George has become much more normal than you.",3
JERRY,11:25,11:26,Really?,3

JERRY,14:47,14:48,It was stupid of me.,3
SHEILA,14:48,14:50,"Well, it was very insulting.",3
JERRY,14:50,14:52,No. I know. I - I was really sort of half-kidding.,3
SHEILA,14:53,14:56,"Well, behind every joke there's some truth.",3
JERRY,14:56,15:09,"What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? There's no truth to that. Nobody with a terminal illness goes from the United States to Europe for a piece of Bavarian cream pie and then when they get there and they don't have it he says "" Aw, I'll just have some coffee."" There's no truth to that.",3
SHEILA,15:10,15:11,"Well, I guess you're right.",3
JERRY,15:13,15:14,"So, am I forgiven, shmoopy?",3
SHEILA,15:14,15:15,"Yes, shmoopy.",3
JERRY,15:14,15:15,Aw!,3
SUSAN,15:15,15:19,"Hey, Jerry!",3
JERRY,15:19,15:23,"Oh, hi Susan, George. You remember Sheila.",3
GEORGE,15:23,15:24,"Oh, yes. Hello.",3
SHEILA,15:24,15:25,Hello. Won't you join us?,3
GEORGE,15:25,15:26,"No, thanks. Yes. Well --",3
SUSAN,15:25,15:26,Of course.,3
GEORGE,15:30,15:32,"So, uh,",3
GEORGE,15:32,15:34,"sit on the same side at a booth, huh?",3
JERRY,15:34,15:36,Yeah. That's right. You got a problem?,3
GEORGE,15:38,15:45,"I, uh, just think it's a little unusual. Two people to sit on one side...and leave the other side empty.",3
JERRY,15:45,15:47,"Well, we're changing the rules.",3
GEORGE,15:47,15:49,Ahh. Good for you.,3
SUSAN,15:49,15:51,"Aw, what are you getting George?",3
GEORGE,15:53,16:05,"I don't know, honey. What do you want to get? [in babying voice] I want you to get anything you want...'cause I love you so much. I want you to be happy. Okay, sweetie?",3
SUSAN,16:05,16:07,"Oh, George, you're so sweet.",3
GEORGE,16:07,16:10,"Well, I could be a little sweetie tweetie weetie weetie.",3
SUSAN,16:11,16:12,Aww!,3
JERRY,16:12,16:16,"What about you, shmoopy? How 'bout a little tuna? You want a little tuna fishy?",3
SHEILA,16:16,16:17,Yeah.,3
JERRY,16:17,16:19,Yum yum little tuna fishy?,3

KRAMER,16:35,16:36,Yeah.,3
ELAINE,16:36,16:40,"Oh! Oh, I love it! I absolutely love it!",3
KRAMER,16:40,16:42,Yeah. Did the K Man do it or did the K Man do it?,3
ELAINE,16:42,16:43,The K Man did it!,3
KRAMER,16:43,16:44,Yeah!,3
ELAINE,16:44,16:46,[laughing] How much did you pay for this thing?,3
KRAMER,16:46,16:47,How 'bout zero?,3
ELAINE,16:47,16:48,What?,3
KRAMER,16:48,16:49,Yeah.,3
ELAINE,16:48,16:50,What? Who's was it? Where'd you get it?,3
KRAMER,16:50,16:54,I'll tell ya where I got it. I got it from the guy you so callously refer to as the Soup Nazi.,3
ELAINE,16:54,16:56,Get out!,3
ELAINE,16:59,17:02,The Soup Nazi gave it to you? Why?,3
KRAMER,17:01,17:02,Yeah.,3
KRAMER,17:02,17:05,"Well, I told him the whole story and he just let me have it.",3
KRAMER,17:06,17:11,"Wha -- Yeah. He's a wonderful man. Yeah. Well, a little bit misunderstood but, uh....",3
ELAINE,17:11,17:16,"Well, I'm just gonna go down there and personally thank him. I mean, I had this guy all wrong. This is wonderful!",3
KRAMER,17:16,17:18,"Yeah. Well, he's a dear.",3
GEORGE,17:21,17:23,How much tip do you leave on $8.15?,3
SUSAN,17:23,17:37,"You know sweetie, I just want you to know that I was so proud of you today expressing your feelings so freely in front of Jerry and all. Just knowing that you're not afraid of those things is such a great step forward in our relationship.",3
GEORGE,17:38,17:39,Huh?,3
SUSAN,17:41,17:46,[in babying voice] Because you love your little kiki don't you?,3
CUSTOMER,17:52,17:53,How is he today?,3
BANIA,17:54,17:55,I think he's in a good mood.,3
ELAINE,17:56,18:08,"Hi. You know, Kramer gave me the armoire and it is so beautiful. I'm mean, I just can't tell you how much I appreciate it.",3
SOUP NAZI,18:08,18:20,"You? If I knew it was for you, I never would have given it to him in the first place! I would have taken a hatchet and smashed it to pieces! Now, who wants soup? Next! Speak up!",3
JERRY,18:26,18:28,I'm heading over to Elaine's.,3
KRAMER,18:29,18:32,"Oh. Jerry, those are the guys that mugged me for the armoire.",3
JERRY,18:32,18:33,Those two?,3
KRAMER,18:32,18:33,Yeah.,3
JERRY,18:33,18:34,Are you sure?,3
KRAMER,18:33,18:34,Yeah. That's them.,3
JERRY,18:35,18:36,"Well, let's confront 'em.",3
KRAMER,18:35,18:37,No. No. No. No. Let's get a cop.,3
JERRY,18:37,18:41,There's no cops around. They're gonna leave. Come on.,3
KRAMER,18:40,18:41,No!,3
BOB,18:41,18:44,"Oh, wow look, that one is gorgeous. I would just kill for that one.",3
RAY,18:44,18:46,"Oh, not in blue. Blue does not go with all.",3
BOB,18:46,18:51,"Oh, please. Do you know what you're talking about? Because I don't think you know what you're talking about. Take a look at that.",3
KRAMER,18:51,18:52,Excuse me.,3
RAY,18:54,18:55,Are you talking to me?,3
KRAMER,18:55,18:56,"Uh, well, uh, we --",3
RAY,18:56,18:58,"I said, are you talking to me?",3
BOB,18:58,19:07,"Well, maybe, he was talking to me. Was you talking to him? Because you was obviously talking to one of us. So what is it? Who?! Who was you talking to?!",3
KRAMER,19:10,19:15,"Well, wha -- I, uh -- uh, we were kind of, uh, talking to each other, weren't we?",3
ELAINE,19:21,19:28,"I mean, you know, I've never been so insulted in my entire life. There's something really wrong with this man. He is a Soup Nazi. What? What is that?",3
JERRY,19:34,19:41,"I don't know. "" 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds of celery, chopped parsley...""",3
ELAINE,19:41,19:48,"Let me see this. [gasps] You know what this is? This is a recipe for soup, and look at this. There are like thirty different recipes. These are his recipes!",3
JERRY,19:48,19:49,So?,3
ELAINE,19:50,20:00,"So? So, his secret's out. Don't you see? I could give these to every restaurant in town. I could have 'em published! I could - I could drop fliers from a plane above the city.",3
JERRY,20:00,20:02,"Wait a second, Elaine. Where do you think you're going?",3
ELAINE,20:02,20:03,What do you care?,3
JERRY,20:03,20:07,"Elaine, I don't want you causing any trouble down at that soup stand. I happen to love that soup.",3
ELAINE,20:08,20:09,"Get out of my way, Jerry.",3
JERRY,20:09,20:11,"Elaine, let the man make his soup!",3
ELAINE,20:11,20:14,"Don't make me hurt you, Jerry.",3

SUSAN,20:35,20:37,"Oh, no! That's too bad.",3
JERRY,20:37,20:46,"Yeah. Well, she was very affectionate - which I love. You know I love that - but mentally, we couldn't quite make the connection.",3
GEORGE,20:46,20:47,Really?,3
JERRY,20:47,20:56,"Yeah. Too bad, 'cause you gotta have the affection - which you obviously have. I think it's great that you're so open with your affections in public. See, we had that.",3
GEORGE,20:56,20:57,You did?,3
JERRY,20:57,21:04,"Oh, yeah. But the mental thing. But anyway. I'll see ya.",3

NEWMAN,22:12,22:25,"Elaine's down there causing all kinds of commotion. Somehow she got a hold of his recipes and she says she's gonna drive him out of business! The Soup Nazi said that now that his recipes are out, he's not gonna make anymore soup! He's moving out of the country, moving to Argentina! No more soup, Jerry! No more soup for any of us!",3
